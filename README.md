# Malay Language Google Sheets Translator

This project is a Malay language Google Sheets translator. It fetches the meaning, synonyms, and sample usage sentences of Malay words from the website [PRPM DBP](https://prpm.dbp.gov.my/) and populates them into a Google Sheets document using the Google Sheets API and the Beautiful Soup package.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
1. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using the command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Ensure you have a Google Cloud project with the Sheets API enabled.
3. Download the `credentials.json` file for your project and place it in the root directory of this project.

### Running the Script
Run the script using the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Script Workflow
The script performs the following steps:
1. Authenticates with the Google Sheets API using OAuth2.
2. Reads Malay words from column A of the Google Sheet.
3. Fetches the meaning and related information for each word from the specified website.
4. Populates the results into column E of the same Google Sheet.

### Notes
- The script skips rows where the Malay word starts with an asterisk (`*`) or if column E already contains data.
- The Google Sheets document ID is hardcoded in the script. Replace `SPREADSHEET_ID` in `main.py` with your own Google Sheets document ID if needed.
- The script uses `token.json` to store authentication tokens. This file is automatically generated after the first run.

## Dependencies
- **Beautiful Soup**: For web scraping.
- **Google API Client Libraries**: For Sheets API integration.
- **Requests**: For HTTP requests.
